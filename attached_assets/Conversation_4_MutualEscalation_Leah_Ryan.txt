Leah: You never listen to me! You’re always glued to your phone when I’m talking.
Ryan: Oh, like you’re any better? You ignore me all the time!
Leah: At least I try! You don’t even make an effort anymore.
Ryan: Yeah? What’s the point? You just twist everything I say anyway!
Leah: I wouldn’t have to if you actually listened!
Ryan: You’re impossible to talk to!
Leah: Because you never take me seriously!
Ryan: You’re always starting fights out of nothing!
Leah: Nothing? Are you serious?
Ryan: Yes, every little thing turns into World War III with you!
Leah: You make me feel like I don’t even matter!
Ryan: And you make me feel like I can’t do anything right!
Leah: Because you never even try!
Ryan: Why should I when you’re always on my case?
Leah: Because that’s what people do when they care!
Ryan: I’m done trying if this is how it’s going to be!
Leah: Maybe you should be done then!
Ryan: Fine!
Leah: Fine!
