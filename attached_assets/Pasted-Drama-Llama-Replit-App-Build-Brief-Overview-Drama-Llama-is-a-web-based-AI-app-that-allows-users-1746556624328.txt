Drama Llama – Replit App Build Brief
📌 Overview
Drama Llama is a web-based AI app that allows users to analyze conversations for emotional tone, communication dynamics, and red flags. It's built to offer clarity and insight — not judgment — using ChatGPT-4o via API. It has tiered access levels and multiple input methods.

🛠️ Tech Stack (Replit-Compatible)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS (Vanilla or React)

Backend: Node.js or Flask (depending on familiarity)

AI Integration: OpenAI API (GPT-4o)

Storage: LocalStorage (for testing), Replit DB or Supabase (for account plans)

OCR (for screenshots): Tesseract.js (client-side OCR)

🔐 Tier-Based Access (attached tier model applies)
Each account is linked to a tier:

Free: Basic tone insights, 1/month limit

Personal (£4.99/mo): 10/month, advice, flags, tracking

Pro (£9.99/mo): Unlimited, benchmarks, Drama Score™, historical analysis

Frontend should:

Detect logged-in tier

Show a visible count/limit

Adjust backend prompt and output format based on plan

💡 Core Features
✅ 1. Chat Analysis
UI has 3 tabs:

Paste Chat (textarea)

Import Chat File (.txt/.csv)

Upload Screenshot (image input)

Name Detection: Button to scan and detect speaker names → populate Me and Them fields

Switch Roles: Swap fields if misassigned

Analyze Button (enabled only after names are detected)

✅ 2. One Message Analysis
Simple textbox (max 500 characters)

Toggle: “Who wrote this? Me / Them”

Output: Tone, possible intent, suggested reply

Disclaimer under box: “Single-message analysis may lack context. Interpret thoughtfully.”

✅ 3. Vent Mode
User pastes a message they want to send

AI returns calmer, emotionally grounded version

Use GPT to "de-escalate while preserving intent"

✅ 4. Live Talk (Pro)
Optional audio recorder → transcribe to text (Whisper API or placeholder)

Treat transcript as chat for analysis

🧠 AI Analysis Engine (GPT-4o)
Each tier triggers a different prompt:

Prompts are stored in backend (linked to account tier)

Free tier uses basic tone + pattern prompt

Personal/Pro use advanced prompts with more flags, summaries, and visuals

(Use tier-based prompts already created in your project doc.)
