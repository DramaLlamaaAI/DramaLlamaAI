Here‚Äôs a thorough breakdown of how to improve the screenshot extraction feature and achieve highly accurate results for your WhatsApp-style interface, leveraging Azure‚Äôs OCR APIs and well-tested logic for precise left/right bubble detection and participant labeling.

üöÄ Key Improvements for Screenshot Extraction
1Ô∏è‚É£ Better OCR Configuration with Azure Computer Vision
Use Read API (latest version) from Azure Computer Vision for better text extraction compared to older OCR APIs.

Make sure the images are being sent to the Read API in high quality (JPEG/PNG, max 4 MB for best results).

Enable bounding box detection so that you get the X/Y coordinates for each piece of text.

Example Azure OCR call:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const response = await fetch(`https://<your-region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v3.2/read/analyze`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': '<your-key>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream'
  },
  body: screenshotBuffer
});
2Ô∏è‚É£ Smart Bubble Grouping
Your current extraction logic seems to assign every single line as a new message, which is causing split sentences and confusion. Fix by:

‚úÖ Group words by vertical (Y) proximity

If two lines have close Y coordinates (like within 10‚Äì20px), group them together as one message.

‚úÖ Horizontal (X) position detection

X < 50% of image width = left speaker

X > 50% of image width = right speaker

Example grouping logic:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const groupedMessages = [];
let currentMessage = [];
let lastY = null;

for (const word of words) {
  if (lastY === null || Math.abs(word.y - lastY) < 20) {
    currentMessage.push(word.text);
  } else {
    groupedMessages.push(currentMessage.join(' '));
    currentMessage = [word.text];
  }
  lastY = word.y;
}
if (currentMessage.length > 0) {
  groupedMessages.push(currentMessage.join(' '));
}
3Ô∏è‚É£ Auto-Assign Left/Right Participants
Using X position of each bubble:

X < 50% ‚Üí Left speaker

X ‚â• 50% ‚Üí Right speaker

Let users manually confirm these participants (like you already do with the ‚ÄúMy Name‚Äù and ‚ÄúTheir Name‚Äù inputs).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Remove Timestamps/Status Lines
Currently, the timestamps (like 8:28 V/) are getting mixed in.
‚úÖ Strip lines that match a time pattern (\d{1,2}:\d{2}) or match tick marks (like ‚úì or V/).
‚úÖ Only keep bubbles that contain actual conversational text.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Enhance UI for Clear User Flow
‚úÖ Instead of listing them all together (like ‚ÄúLeft/Gray‚Äù and ‚ÄúRight/Green‚Äù), split them into 2 scrollable columns side-by-side, showing the actual conversation flow.

‚úÖ Let users:

Edit any message directly

Drag/drop to reorder (if needed)

Re-assign speaker for any bubble if OCR was slightly off

6Ô∏è‚É£ Handle Edge Cases
‚úÖ Allow for multi-image uploads and merge text from multiple screenshots by sorting them by file upload order.
‚úÖ Provide a ‚ÄúFocus on Recent Messages‚Äù date filter to only include messages with dates in that range (date parsing logic needed).

üí° Example Final Flow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload screenshots
2Ô∏è‚É£ User sets: "Left side = Me" / "Right side = Other"
3Ô∏è‚É£ Backend:

Azure OCR extracts text & coordinates

Group words into bubbles

Determine left/right by X coordinate

Remove timestamps/status

Output structured JSON with speaker names and message text
4Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend:

Show editable conversation preview

Let user confirm messages & participants

Analyze conversation

üèóÔ∏è Next Steps for Implementation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend:

Use Azure Read API with bounding boxes.

Implement grouping logic to merge bubble lines.

Filter out timestamps/status markers.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend:

Create 2-column preview that clearly shows who said what.

Let user adjust speaker names if OCR messed up.

Keep ‚ÄúMy messages are on the left/right‚Äù toggle to override auto-assignment.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Integration:

Test different phone types (iOS/Android/WhatsApp/Facebook styles) to ensure bubble positions work correctly in all screenshots.

Provide fallback manual assignment if automated logic fails (for edge cases).
