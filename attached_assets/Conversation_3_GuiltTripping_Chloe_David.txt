Chloe: You didn’t even notice I was upset earlier. I guess you just don’t care anymore.
David: I’m really sorry, Chloe. I honestly didn’t realize. Can we talk about it now?
Chloe: You always say that, but nothing changes.
David: I’m trying to understand. Please tell me what’s wrong.
Chloe: It’s like I’m invisible to you half the time.
David: That’s not true, I’ve been stressed at work, but I care deeply.
Chloe: Work is always your excuse.
David: I get that it sounds like that, but it’s not intentional.
Chloe: I’m tired of explaining the same things over and over.
David: I want to get this right. Help me understand.
Chloe: You should already understand if you really cared.
David: I do care, I just don’t want to make assumptions.
Chloe: You don’t have to assume, I’m literally telling you.
David: Okay, I hear you. What can I do differently?
Chloe: I don’t know anymore, David. It feels pointless.
David: It’s not pointless to me. Let’s work on it.
Chloe: I just feel like I’m the only one who tries.
David: You’re not alone in this. I’m here.
Chloe: Then show me you mean it, not just with words.
David: I will. Starting now. Can we start fresh?
