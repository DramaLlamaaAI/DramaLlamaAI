[Manipulative Conversation]

Alex: Wow, I guess you're too busy for me again.
Jamie: I’ve just had a lot going on, but I’m here now. What’s up?
Alex: Forget it. I shouldn’t have to beg for attention.
Jamie: I’m not ignoring you, just overwhelmed. I care about you.
Alex: You always have an excuse. Maybe I care more than you do.
Jamie: That’s not true. I’ve been trying.
Alex: Sure, blame me again. You always make me the problem.
Jamie: I’m not blaming you. I want to work through this.
Alex: You say that, but nothing ever changes. I’m done talking.
