🎯 Enhanced Nuance Detection System for Drama Llama AI
🔍 1. Context-Aware Flagging
Rule:
Do not flag emotionally vulnerable or explanatory language as red flags unless:

It is followed by coercion, guilt-tripping, threats, or blame

It is clearly part of a larger manipulative pattern

Example:

“I’m just overwhelmed. I’m not ignoring you.”
✅ Interpret as: Defensive reassurance
❌ Do not flag as: Manipulation or evasion

Prompt/Logic Instruction:

Check whether emotionally charged statements follow an accusation or are part of a de-escalation attempt. Avoid flagging unless emotional pressure or guilt is implied.

🧠 2. Intent Classification Tags
When analyzing tone, classify key quotes under intent categories to add emotional depth:

Intent	Example
Defensive reassurance	“I do care about you.”
Accountability	“That’s on me.” / “I should’ve told you.”
Minimizing	“You’re overreacting.” / “This isn’t a big deal.”
Redirecting	“What about when you…?” / “Well, you’re not perfect.”
Genuine concern	“I didn’t know. How can I help?” / “I want to understand.”

Output example:

“I do care about you.”
Tone Intent: Defensive reassurance — attempting to calm tension without escalation.

🔒 3. Safe Expression Library (Non-Flagging Phrases)
Prevent false red flags by maintaining a "Safe List" of phrases that demonstrate emotional openness or de-escalation:

Examples to protect:

“I care about you.”

“This is hard, but I want to understand.”

“Let’s talk about it calmly.”
