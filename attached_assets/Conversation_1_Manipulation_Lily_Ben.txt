Lily: I never said I’d meet you at 7. You always twist my words.
Ben: I have the texts right here, Lily. You literally said 7. I’m not trying to argue.
Lily: I don’t know what you think you saw, but it wasn’t me saying that.
Ben: You said it yesterday at lunch, and then you texted me again to confirm.
Lily: I seriously don’t remember that. Why are you always trying to catch me out?
Ben: I’m not trying to catch you out, I just want us to be on the same page.
Lily: You’re making me feel like I’m crazy. Are you happy now?
Ben: That’s not what I’m trying to do, I just want to understand what happened.
Lily: You never trust me. It’s exhausting to be constantly doubted.
Ben: I do trust you, that’s why I’m trying to clarify.
Lily: You’re always picking fights over nothing.
Ben: I just don’t understand why this keeps happening.
Lily: Because you’re obsessed with proving me wrong all the time.
Ben: That’s not fair. I just want clear communication.
Lily: Well, you’re not very good at that, are you?
Ben: I’m trying, but you keep dismissing what I’m saying.
Lily: Maybe because what you’re saying makes no sense.
Ben: Can we please just agree to meet halfway?
Lily: There’s nothing to agree on because I never said it.
Ben: Alright… maybe I misunderstood. Can we move on now?
