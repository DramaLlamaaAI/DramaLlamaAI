Zara: Hey, I felt a little hurt when you canceled last minute last night.
Owen: I totally get that. I’m really sorry, Zara. Work ran over, and I should’ve let you know sooner.
Zara: Thanks for saying that. I was looking forward to seeing you.
Owen: I was too. I hated having to miss it.
Zara: It just felt disappointing, you know?
Owen: Absolutely. You had every right to feel that way.
Zara: I don’t want us to fall into bad habits.
Owen: Neither do I. Communication is really important to me.
Zara: Same here. I’m glad we’re talking about this.
Owen: Me too. Can we plan something for this weekend?
Zara: I’d love that. Maybe dinner at our usual spot?
Owen: Perfect idea. I’ll make the reservation.
Zara: Thank you for listening, Owen.
Owen: Of course, I care about how you feel.
Zara: It means a lot. I really appreciate you.
Owen: And I appreciate you. You always make time for us.
Zara: That’s what partners do, right?
Owen: Exactly. We’re a team.
Zara: Looking forward to our weekend.
Owen: Me too. It’s a date.
