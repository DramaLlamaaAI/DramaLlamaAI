15/02/2024, 18:03 - Hayley Swift: I will send Scott your number 😉
16/02/2024, 19:09 - Els: You deleted this message
16/02/2024, 19:09 - Els: Lemme know if you can get money to invest. 
I'll pay yo u back monthly to cover the amount = 0 risk
15% on what ever the investment makes. 

I feel you'll make at least 5k *profit* minimum within th next 6 months
16/02/2024, 20:19 - Hayley Swift: I will see how much I have saved with my dad. I’m willing to invest as I trust you and believe in you. 
I’m talking to Scott, he’s worried about the risk…..at the end of the day - if you don’t take risks you will never know- don’t regret what you never did. I don’t really own anything to worry. The amount of money I live on is hand to mouth. If it doesn’t work, I will go back to the idea of selling dirty knickers online 🤣 xx
16/02/2024, 20:21 - Hayley Swift: Are you still out ?
16/02/2024, 20:24 - Els: I fully understand the risk.  That's why I'm saying I pay back each month to oay off. So it's more of a loan at +15%
16/02/2024, 21:28 - Hayley Swift: I don’t want to make money off you if it doesn’t work? This is my risk and responsibility- let’s get together one night next week and see what we can come up with xxx
16/02/2024, 21:30 - Hayley Swift: Obviously if you do good I want to make money but you have done me a service so we need to go into this fair x
16/02/2024, 21:58 - Els: That's the risk I'll take incase it doesn't work out. I'll pay you your Investment back. Then you get X %
16/02/2024, 22:01 - Els: Or u can Inest 5k, get 2.5k back and get 25%...its up for negotiation
16/02/2024, 22:36 - Hayley Swift: Can I be a hidden partner, help fund you and cream profits but keep the investment money in?
16/02/2024, 22:40 - Els: Not sure what you mean 😅...send 5k.
In 10 months you'll have your 5k back 
Plus 15% of the Investment
16/02/2024, 22:43 - Els: What ever u Inevst. I'll pay back over X amount of month. Zero risk
16/02/2024, 22:43 - Hayley Swift: I’ve had a drink so I’m thinking, this could fund the charity I have always dreamed of. Home for kids but with a difference- kids that can be helped. The lost kids in the middle. I’m not strong enough to deal with kids that need specialist help. But the ones that are going through stuff, that just need routine/ basic skills etc
16/02/2024, 22:44 - Els: What ever happens...I'll lay u back the 5k over 10 months
16/02/2024, 22:45 - Els: U front 5k
I pay u bk 5k
No risk
16/02/2024, 22:50 - Hayley Swift: I know you would, I do trust you… I’ve been fucked over before but you are different. You remind me of my younger self. Ambitious, but we are also conscious of other people’s feelings. I wish I was a hard fucker - No I don’t…I can sleep at night- apart from when I was at school- 13 yrs old
16/02/2024, 22:51 - Hayley Swift: Zoe Donaldson didn’t have legs. She was in a wheelchair or had dead straight plastic legs <This message was edited>
16/02/2024, 22:52 - Hayley Swift: I have always gone brown as a berry in the sun 🌞
16/02/2024, 22:54 - Hayley Swift: That 7 toed stumpy cow, used to ram her wheelchair into my brown legs 🤣🤣🤣
16/02/2024, 22:54 - Hayley Swift: She had 7 toes on one stump
16/02/2024, 22:57 - Hayley Swift: I put her plastic legs on the hooks in the changing room after PE - this is the cruelest thing I’ve ever done. She couldn’t get her legs down. And it was a big thing- who did it 🥴
16/02/2024, 22:58 - Hayley Swift: Well she was a slag too - boys used to date each other to finger her - she was well up for it 🤣🤣🤣
16/02/2024, 22:58 - Hayley Swift: That’s like shagging a midget
16/02/2024, 23:01 - Hayley Swift: The weirdest thing is all the boys that fingered her was from Welham Green 🤣
16/02/2024, 23:08 - Hayley Swift: Ps I’m sitting here listening to farts 💨 off Scott’s phone on loud speaker- some of them sound really shitty 🤣🤣🤣

22/03/2024, 21:14 - Els: I feel like these are a bit of you
22/03/2024, 21:14 - Els: Exactly 🤣
22/03/2024, 21:15 - Els: Except nellie. Coz I'm definitely not thinking "mum. Mum. Mum. Muuum. Muum. Gues what. Muum" all day 😅
22/03/2024, 21:15 - Hayley Swift: Did you see what I put on our work chat 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I don’t know why I did that- 🤷🏻‍♀️
22/03/2024, 21:15 - Els: Nah I'm not in it
22/03/2024, 21:15 - Els: What did you do 😅

22/03/2024, 21:19 - Hayley Swift: Carla has done exactly what you said and tried turning it around
22/03/2024, 21:22 - Hayley Swift: Tuesday we have a meeting with Nicolette- I’m happy with it because we need support and experienced knowledge but she isn’t happy- I said to her, I have respect for nic - it least she wants to help…Carla feels micro managed 😆 obviously 🙄
22/03/2024, 21:22 - Els: Classic narc
22/03/2024, 21:22 - Els: Carla thinks she might go on a PIP
22/03/2024, 21:24 - Els: <Media omitted>
22/03/2024, 21:24 - Els: Have a 10 minute read into narcasism
22/03/2024, 21:26 - Hayley Swift: But why ? I am a big believer in not being complacent and take what you need. I am scatty, and find things quite difficult when pressure is on, but I’m growing with confidence. I’m not going anywhere so need to know my job. Knowledge is power 🤷🏻‍♀️
22/03/2024, 21:27 - Hayley Swift: It fun watching people come and go, I’ve learned to sit back and watch…..we know the cooo
22/03/2024, 21:29 - Els: No idea. anxiety, on her part probably. She also said that the account manager is just passing the blame of him being a shit salesman...she's contradicting herself
22/03/2024, 22:48 - Hayley Swift: But Salvatore is doing extremely well- that’s why we are busy, he is good at his job but things not being done straight away, hinders me placing the orders ……. Kerry and Nic are not stupid, that’s why I’m embracing it. At the end of the day none of these people are my mates - they are work colleagues. You and Barrel are my only friends at work. I do really like Gemma, she is a good person and real. I admire her boundaries, she doesn’t want or need any shite, but she still mixes. I respect her completely x
23/03/2024, 06:19 - Els: Oh she mentioned, Rob as the AM? Maybe she's just delusional. 
Anyway...we just keep our heads down. Do what we can to the best of our abilities x

19/04/2024, 19:54 - Els: Thank you x...Think she said she lives in Buckinghamshire now though. I think if I do it through PayPal I'm more protected. And I'll get her to transfer the names after first payment to share the risk
19/04/2024, 20:10 - Hayley Swift: The offer is there- it’s about the kids and Sam really. I’d hate for you to be scammed- we will all track her down 💪🏼 😉
19/04/2024, 20:11 - Hayley Swift: Scott is saying don’t send her any money without going to her house- we will get you there

27/04/2024, 18:59 - Hayley Swift: Spanish is a good language to learn- once you have your head around it, start teaching Nels - my kids started at 4 years old and they are to of the class with Spanish- rubbish at English (like their mum 🤣🤣) xxx
27/04/2024, 20:25 - Hayley Swift: How old is sams eldest daughter? I have some clothes- size 6- I have put them on group chat but happy to send you photos and I will wash everything before hand? X

Just say the word and we could make a night of it in fancy dress 😉😂😂😂
20/08/2024, 09:36 - Els: Hey babes. Hope you're good. Do you think you're still in a position to lend £500 at all please? 
Please please please don't leave yourself short. Sam said she can pay back on the 14th September. (All my August wage is going to pay back people I've already promised that I've borrowed from) 
 *Best case scenario* - the scumbag pays me and I can pay you back out of that. 
 *Middle scenario* - Sam pays on 14th September.
 *Worst case* - I'll pay back from September's pay cheque. Xx - Sam should pull through if the scammer  doesn't 

Again, please don't leave yourself short.
20/08/2024, 09:40 - Hayley Swift: I am a bit short myself - but let me see if I can borrow money from my dad ..... I've just paid out for carpet and bedroom furniture for Nelly

10/03/2025, 20:12 - Els: For lunches we can have a rota one or two days and cook each other random pasta concoctions. Probably spend like £10 a week each
10/03/2025, 20:14 - Hayley Swift: Yep sounds good 👍🏻 I have some lunch for us tomorrow. Pork and rice - leftovers from tonight. Xx
10/03/2025, 20:18 - Els: I've already done some pasta. I had the idea when dishing up x

13/03/2025, 20:47 - Hayley Swift: Thank you 🙏🏻...have we got a lunchtime session on. I'm loving this because, we both like cooking, never have the time, but this way I'm looking at cheap, easy, healthy food. We could get a blog ( I think that's the right word 😁), tick tock - whatever, and do desk dinners 😂🫰🏻❤️☝🏻💡

19/04/2025, 21:33 - Els: Thank you  proper fucked up. Absolutely no reason for it, and the amount I've done for her, took her kids to bulgaria for a holiday, never stopped nellie seeing Sam. She's seen an opportunity and taken it. Likely run out of money and wants the benefits x
19/04/2025, 21:36 - Hayley Swift: I think we can get Legal advice from work, I will support you with it. You need to get parental responsibility as you weren't married. The court will issue that. It's the Watford family court you will need to go to. X
19/04/2025, 21:40 - Hayley Swift: The school should also support you for reference on how she is always on time, and how she is well looked after. Michael would also vouch for how work has supported you with flexibility so you are able to work and still be a fantastic dad x
19/04/2025, 21:40 - Hayley Swift: Scott said he has sent it
19/04/2025, 21:41 - Hayley Swift: I thought I was the only one to get dick pics 😂😂😂
19/04/2025, 21:42 - Els: Yeah so I've got Nellie's health visitor and a social worker looking into things. Like you say, I'll get support from the school when I drop it on them on Tuesday. 
Have thought about character references etc...Still trying to process it , get over the emotions and approach it logically x
19/04/2025, 21:42 - Hayley Swift: You will need a good strong support network through this xxx
19/04/2025, 21:42 - Els: Got all Sam's family on my side too
19/04/2025, 21:43 - Hayley Swift: Good and your mum xx
19/04/2025, 21:44 - Hayley Swift: She is doing it because she can see you are a stable parent, unfortunately she has to work through her problems xxxx
19/04/2025, 21:45 - Hayley Swift: Your head must be all over the place. You are more than welcome to pop round if you are at a loose end. Xxxxx
19/04/2025, 21:53 - Els: I appreciate it. I'll probably take next week off work. They way I'm looking at it is nellie isn't aware of the situation, and is probably having a great time with her siblings. She has missed them xx
19/04/2025, 21:55 - Hayley Swift: Bless her, yes you always put her first and that's how it should be xxxx
19/04/2025, 21:59 - Hayley Swift: I have been through a court case with Nelly and Sollie. It's hard, and you will be up and down. It will turn out good, you're not an arsehole 😘 x
21/04/2025, 17:11 - Hayley Swift: Hello love, how are you doing xxx
21/04/2025, 17:13 - Els: Hey. I'm OK. Holding it together. Health visitor n social will be back working tomorrow so thins should start moving from tomorrow. Gna sign myself off for the week to focus on what I need to focus on
21/04/2025, 17:13 - Els: Xxx
21/04/2025, 17:14 - Hayley Swift: If you need anything let me know. I'm happy to drive you anywhere, even if I need to take a day off. Xxx 😘
21/04/2025, 17:15 - Els: I appreciate that, thank you xxx
22/04/2025, 20:29 - Els: I've gone through all mine and sams chats so professionals can see I've been extremely amicable and willing. I've prepared the following statement for court (with the help of AI) - I just need to tweak it abit as its confused darcy and rudie as my own children.

Statement in Support of C100 Application – Elliott [Surname]
Re: Nellie [Surname]
DOB: [Insert DOB]
Applicant: Elliott [Full Name]
Respondent: Sam [Full Name]
Date: [Insert Date]
1. Introduction
I, Elliott [Surname], am the father and primary carer of Nellie [Surname], aged [insert age], and I am submitting this statement in support of my urgent C100 application for a Child Arrangements Order, including a request for immediate return of the child to my care and a Prohibited Steps Order to prevent any further unauthorised removal by her mother, Sam [Surname].

2. Background
Nellie has been residing with me full-time for the past six months. This arrangement began due to concerns over Sam’s behaviour, lifestyle instability, and unpredictable conduct, including:

Regular overnight absences without communication while she was responsible for Nellie and my other children.

Erratic sleep patterns (e.g., staying awake all night, sleeping until mid-afternoon).

A confirmed incident of vandalism in my residential building, where her handwriting was identified on the graffiti.

Suspected substance misuse, supported by physical signs and third-party allegations.

Multiple occasions of neglecting to supervise or return home while I was unexpectedly left with her children for hours.

Despite these issues, I remained open to Sam having supervised and structured contact, provided Nellie’s safety and wellbeing were not compromised.

3. Current Situation – Urgent Safeguarding Concern
On or around [insert date of removal], Sam removed Nellie from my care without consent, and has since blocked all contact with me. I have had no communication regarding Nellie’s whereabouts, condition, or wellbeing. She has also prevented my two other children (Darcy and Rudie) from giving Nellie their Christmas presents, which were previously arranged to be shared.

This removal was entirely unauthorised and occurred despite Nellie being settled and safe in my care, with:

A secure home environment.

A consistent daily routine.

Enrolment in local school and support from my family and community network.

I believe Nellie is currently at serious emotional and physical risk due to Sam’s demonstrated inability to maintain a stable or safe caregiving environment.

4. Request to the Court
I respectfully request the court to:

List this matter as urgent to ensure Nellie’s immediate safety.

Grant a temporary Child Arrangements Order returning Nellie to my care until a full hearing can be scheduled.

Issue a Prohibited Steps Order preventing Sam from removing Nellie from my care without express written consent or a court order.

Consider appointing a Cafcass officer to assess the situation and Nellie’s best interests.

5. Final Statement
My sole focus is Nellie’s welfare. I have made every effort to co-parent amicably, but recent events have made it impossible to safeguard Nellie without court intervention. I am deeply concerned for her emotional and physical safety while in Sam’s care, and I urge the court to act swiftly to ensure her immediate return to a stable and secure environment.

I am willing to fully cooperate with Cafcass, social services, or any other relevant body to resolve this matter in the best interests of our daughter.

Signed:
Elliott [Surname]
Date: [Insert Date]
Contact Information: [Insert address and phone number if required by the court]
22/04/2025, 22:52 - Hayley Swift: Well done, it's straight and direct. Also it's fair. So still no sign of Nellie or Sam ? What about the refuge she was staying at? Xx
22/04/2025, 22:53 - Els: No sign. No contact or explanation from Sam
22/04/2025, 22:54 - Els: I can't get hold of the refuge. So no idea what they're saying
22/04/2025, 22:57 - Hayley Swift: Surely there must be a social worker signed to her? I understand you can't approach the refuge but surely someone can help you. It's so sad. If you had taken Nellie, I'm sure it would be a different story xxxx
22/04/2025, 23:05 - Els: There is. I called the social worker today, no response so I left a text. Nothing back yet. X
23/04/2025, 07:14 - Hayley Swift: Morning Els, I really hope you get to speak to the social worker today. And try to get your court application in. Xxxxx
23/04/2025, 08:10 - Els: Court application went in yesterday morning. Been working on the statements, evidence and proposed contact plan till 3am last night 😴 will keep you posted xx
23/04/2025, 09:48 - Hayley Swift: Bless you, rest up. You need a clear head, maybe go for a walk or run to help. Most of all good sleep xxxx 😘
24/04/2025, 17:30 - Els: Courts have denied an urgent hearing, giving a court date of August. 

I've appealed.
24/04/2025, 17:35 - Hayley Swift: Oh no, 😮..... Good. Have you heard anything from Sam's social worker?
24/04/2025, 17:36 - Hayley Swift: Do you know where Nellie is?
24/04/2025, 17:37 - Els: Nah nothing. The school have submitted a children services referral

I want to keep busy, and I know you are beefing yourself up so I have a bit of digging you could help me with - Scott can't do it because the ground is so uneven he will twist his knees. Mind you I've said that but can you do it with your hip ? BBQ is still on offer whether you can dig or not 😊 xxxx
