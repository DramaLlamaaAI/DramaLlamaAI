01/04/2025, 21:37 - Test Chat: Hey this is my new number
01/04/2025, 21:37 - Test Chat: Wasn't sure if you have it Darcy needed my other one for homework and no idea if nells messaged yet
01/04/2025, 21:37 - Test Chat: As she never tells me ✌️
01/04/2025, 21:38 - Els: Nah nells fell asleep. I did message to let you know, and that no doubt she will remember in the morning and send you a few lol
01/04/2025, 21:39 - Test Chat: Thank you so much for my mother's day bits and dinner tell Nell's in the morning I love them and all my cards I feel very special and loved to get that many home made ones haha
01/04/2025, 21:39 - Test Chat: I best get on the hunt for some appropriate 'child' GIFs that nells will approve of
01/04/2025, 21:40 - Test Chat: I thought she'd crash out as she was at that emotional stage of the evening lol
01/04/2025, 21:40 - Test Chat: Darcy's arm is miraculously healed 😂
06/04/2025, 09:04 - Test Chat: Morning, how's Nell's ?
06/04/2025, 09:05 - Test Chat: What days will we be able to see her over the Easter holidays? Trying to organise things for the kids to do ☺️
06/04/2025, 09:38 - Els: Morning. Shes good, been up since 7:30, technically 6:30 coz the time went forward last week 😅😴....got no plans from Thurday and she's got 2 weeks off so any days from Thurday through the following week really. Let me know your ideas. Fare's on in stanborough atm too btw
06/04/2025, 09:45 - Test Chat: The bump fare 😂😂
06/04/2025, 09:46 - Test Chat: It's actually cheaper to go to Southend for the day and buy the kids bands for the adventure place
06/04/2025, 09:48 - Test Chat: I don't have any ideas yet but I'm working bits out today 🤦lol
06/04/2025, 09:51 - Test Chat: We miss noodles lots and lots can't wait to see her again soon ❤️
06/04/2025, 10:03 - Test Chat: Wait she will be going to my sister's Tuesday though won't she as she's back off holiday then
06/04/2025, 10:13 - Els: is it actually? that's madness
06/04/2025, 10:13 - Els: yeah
06/04/2025, 11:03 - Test Chat: Honestly as you can imagine with a few kids the amount is a joke for a little fare
06/04/2025, 11:04 - Test Chat: Okay cool we will see her then eek 🥰 excited
08/04/2025, 21:58 - Test Chat: https://hertfordgymnastics.co.uk/uniform/
08/04/2025, 22:00 - Test Chat: This is the gymnastic clubs website, and I think their prices for 1-1 and group sessions are quite reasonable. Compared to so many other places I looked at that were over priced for what you got and lacked 1-1 training and personal progression
08/04/2025, 22:00 - Test Chat: I thought the free holiday club was ideal for her to get a taster and see if she likes it and if she doesn't no money wasted 😂
08/04/2025, 22:37 - Els: Sweet. Will take a look tomorrow at work
10/04/2025, 17:43 - Test Chat: Hey how's you and Nell's
10/04/2025, 17:43 - Test Chat: I'm a bit skint until Monday. Could we maybe do soft play get wild on Saturday at the galleria? And then can arrange something a bit more fun for next week when I've been paid?
10/04/2025, 17:44 - Test Chat: I can do the park or lakes or something that doesn't cost but don't have much money until I get paid Monday.. let me know what works for you :)
10/04/2025, 18:04 - Els: Hey. we're good thanks. bit bunged up with cold but nothing too bad.
Sunday would be better, GetWild on the sunday, then stanborough next week some time?
11/04/2025, 12:32 - Test Chat: Yeah ok sounds good
11/04/2025, 12:32 - Test Chat: What time?
11/04/2025, 12:32 - Test Chat: Aw hope you feel better soon
11/04/2025, 13:07 - Els: 12ish?
11/04/2025, 13:41 - Test Chat: Yeah that's works for us
12/04/2025, 11:06 - Test Chat: Could you book soft play for the kids for tomorrow at the time you want
12/04/2025, 11:06 - Test Chat: And I'll send the money for it
12/04/2025, 11:06 - Test Chat: I'm not very good with that booking thing 😂
12/04/2025, 19:40 - Test Chat: Kids mentioned going to the fare tomorrow at stanborough? Could do that and splash park tomorrow instead of soft play ?
12/04/2025, 19:42 - Els: Just got back from the fair. Pretty small and a bit of a bump tbh. Over a 5a for the harnis trampolines
12/04/2025, 20:10 - Test Chat: I did say this .. it's cheaper to do the Southend adventure island all day bands
12/04/2025, 20:11 - Test Chat: Fares bump it now £4 a ride per child no bands or family concessions

13/04/2025, 11:50 - Test Chat: Hey I'm sure you're both needing some chill time today after yesterday's antics 😂.. I was thinking of booking swimming today for like 2ish? then if the kids still had the energy could book the last soft play session also.. the. Grab dinner somewhere close by afterwards?
13/04/2025, 11:51 - Els: We went swimming Friday. Just leaving spoons for the galleria now. You not making 12?

13/04/2025, 11:57 - Els: We'll play tag and hide n seek 😅
13/04/2025, 11:58 - Els: Worried Bout too much chemicals on nells skin
13/04/2025, 11:58 - Test Chat: Ok
13/04/2025, 11:59 - Test Chat: Can we all book for next week ?
13/04/2025, 12:01 - Test Chat: Darcy's a teenage sloth 🦥
13/04/2025, 12:01 - Test Chat: She's getting ready then we'll leave

13/04/2025, 20:49 - Test Chat: Hey, How's Noodles face now, bless her 🤕.. did you manage to find some antiseptic cream? Thankfully only a few grazes that look worse than they are.

14/04/2025, 07:01 - Test Chat: Ouchy I knew the bruising would come out on her forehead, But bruising is a good thing. It should go down pretty quick. Do you have any arnica or aloe Vera gel as that aids the healing and reduces swelling/bruises
14/04/2025, 07:08 - Test Chat: Don't forget to keep an eye on her for any symptoms of concussion, they can sometimes occur after a head injury. but she seemed fine in herself its just a precaution isn't it. Today should be a Well deserved rest day for you both to elax .. although she's probably already up bouncing around the place 😆. Oh yeah reminds me is she going to do a trial day  at the gymnastic club? 🤔 See if she likes it
14/04/2025, 07:23 - Els: Aint got none of that. Just letting the body do its thang. 
Yeah, I have been keeping an eye for concussion. Shes good. Still snoozing. 
Going to get her into David Lloyd I think. As it's only next door, n she has shown interest in starting gymnastics
14/04/2025, 07:23 - Test Chat: The sunny Gs are absolutely fabulous..  little miss trend setter 🕶️ giving off the hippyish flower power vibes ✨ 🌺
14/04/2025, 22:56 - Test Chat: Hey sorry for the late ISH message it's been a hectic day today. How's Nell's face healing up? What days are good/best for you so I can get these days out booked? I don't want to leave it too late as they could get busy with it being the holidays and I need to work some apps around them etc.
15/04/2025, 06:59 - Els: Hey. Thursdays the only day without plans. Her face is healing ok
15/04/2025, 07:00 - Els: <Media omitted>
15/04/2025, 10:22 - Test Chat: Aw the bruising has gone down bless her. Ok shall we do the adventure play then? The weather looks good for Thurs.
15/04/2025, 10:31 - Test Chat: What about the weekend? As they wanted to do the big swimming pool too? Don't know if we would fit both in 1 day I'm not sure on the time you get etc. I'll have have a look
15/04/2025, 10:36 - Els: Sounds good. Not sure how much money I'll have tho, waiting for some to hit my account but could land anytime between now and Friday. Only got £50 in the bank
15/04/2025, 10:37 - Els: Saturday we have a birthday party and Sunday Nellie's going to my mums as Friday we're at Sheadys for an Easter egg hunt. Might be able to have time after the party, think it might finish around 4
15/04/2025, 11:07 - Test Chat: Its fine Im paying for tickets and I'll do packed lunch stuff and snacks and drinks to take
15/04/2025, 11:12 - Test Chat: Places usually bump prices for food and its not even good food either
15/04/2025, 14:33 - Test Chat: I've had a look and the swimming place coral reef is open until 8.45pm on Thursdays.. the adventure park is a 2 hour entry and the pool is a 1.5 hour entry. so we could do both Thursday if that works for you?
15/04/2025, 14:34 - Test Chat: Saturday it shuts at 5pm which is random as surely weekends are busier, but we wouldn't have enough time if her party doesn't finish until 4pm
15/04/2025, 14:39 - Test Chat: The 2 places are only 23 mins apart and there are some nice nature reserves, parks and woodland walks too. could just make a whole day of it around that area, book adventure park for before lunch and swimming for the afternoon. Or either way round but the pool is open later
15/04/2025, 14:40 - Test Chat: Ill check the weather forecast closer and do a picnic if it will be nice, if not go somewhere like a spoons for lunch in between
15/04/2025, 17:10 - Els: Yeah see the weather closer to the time and we'll make a decision tomorrow night or Thursday morning
15/04/2025, 21:06 - Els: Started a walk home for some food. Let me know whats going on please?
15/04/2025, 21:37 - Els: null
15/04/2025, 22:03 - Els: Police have been informed
15/04/2025, 23:45 - Els: You deleted this message
15/04/2025, 23:50 - Els: Nellie doesn’t deserve to be caught in this confusion.  Please bring her back, she shouldn’t have to go through this.
16/04/2025, 10:28 - Els: Can you at least let me know you're all OK?
16/04/2025, 10:31 - Els: _Thank you for your call today, your reference for this incident isHC-15042025-0703. If you need to update us further on this matter please call 101 quoting this reference_
16/04/2025, 10:32 - Els: The police are out looking. Feel free to update them using the above if you don't want to update me or your family
16/04/2025, 12:05 - Els: Just a reminder that Nellie’s epi pens are still with me. Because of her peanut allergy, she needs to have them accessible at all times.

Not ensuring she has access to them could be seen as medical neglect, and I really don’t want things to escalate to that point. Her safety is the priority here.

Please arrange to collect them as soon as possible.

Thanks,
16/04/2025, 20:10 - Els: I hope you understand that everything that’s happened—along with the support I've given you and your children—could significantly impact your position in court. The likely outcome may include supervised visitation for an extended period, which isn't fair to Nellie. Your recent decision to move her into a women's refuge, while you’re either still struggling with addiction or in early recovery, doesn’t appear to prioritize Nellie’s well-being. From where I stand, it seems this move serves your interests more than hers, and I believe the court will recognize that.
17/04/2025, 10:44 - Els: Michelle Knowles.vcf (file attached)
17/04/2025, 10:45 - Els: Please contact Nellie's health visitor. She needs to speak with you
20/04/2025, 22:56 - Els: Just checking if I'm still blocked
26/04/2025, 07:42 - Els: Just checking if I'm still blocked
