Grace: Why are you so sensitive all the time? I was *just* joking.
Leo: It didn’t feel like a joke, Grace. It actually hurt.
Grace: Here we go again. You’re always looking for something to be upset about.
Leo: I’m just trying to share how I feel.
Grace: You’re so exhausting sometimes.
Leo: I don’t want to fight, I just want you to hear me.
Grace: You’re reading way too much into things.
Leo: It didn’t feel small to me.
Grace: Maybe you need to toughen up a little.
Leo: That’s not fair, Grace.
Grace: Fair? You’re impossible to please.
Leo: I just want us to communicate better.
Grace: We *are* communicating. You’re just never satisfied.
Leo: I feel like you’re dismissing me.
Grace: Because you make a big deal out of everything.
Leo: I wish you’d take me seriously.
Grace: I can’t take this every day, Leo.
Leo: I just want to feel heard, that’s all.
Grace: I don’t have the energy for this.
Leo: I’m not trying to start anything. I just want us to understand each other.
