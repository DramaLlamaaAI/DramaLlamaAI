🎯 Overall Flow
1️⃣ User uploads screenshots

UI should accept multiple images in one batch.

Thumbnails preview so user can confirm/reorder.

2️⃣ User identifies which side is theirs (left or right)

Provide an explicit toggle or question:
➜ “Are your messages on the left or right side?”

3️⃣ User inputs participant names

Two input fields:
➜ “Your name”
➜ “Their name”

4️⃣ OCR extraction

Use an OCR engine (like Tesseract.js, Google Vision API, or AWS Textract) to extract all text from the images.

5️⃣ Parsing the extracted text

The AI/logic should split the extracted text into individual messages, usually by analyzing:
➜ Bubble shapes (if visually possible)
➜ Timestamps (if visible)
➜ Line breaks and consistent formatting

6️⃣ Assigning participant names to each message

If the user selected “my messages are on the left,” then all left-aligned bubbles become “Your name,” and right-aligned become “Their name” (and vice versa).

7️⃣ Prefix participant names

In the final parsed text, prefix each message with the relevant participant’s name, e.g.:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Alex: Hey, how are you?  
Jamie: I’m good, you?  
8️⃣ Send to AI for analysis

The parsed, labeled chat transcript is sent to your AI endpoint for red flag detection, emotional tone analysis, etc.

🛠️ Technical/Implementation Steps for Your UI
Here’s how to instruct your UI/Dev team:

✅ 1) Upload UI
Use an <input type="file" multiple> or a drag-and-drop area.

Show thumbnails of uploaded images.

Add reordering controls (arrows, drag-and-drop, etc.).

✅ 2) “Who’s who?” Step
Prompt:
➜ “Are your messages on the left or right?” (radio button or toggle).
➜ “Enter your name” and “Enter their name” fields.

✅ 3) OCR Integration
Use Tesseract.js (JavaScript) or a cloud OCR API like Google Vision.

Process each screenshot, extract raw text.

✅ 4) Parsing & Labeling
UI / AI logic should:
➜ Identify bubbles / line breaks.
➜ Assign participant names based on side chosen by user.
➜ If possible, use basic computer vision (edge detection, color matching) to confirm bubbles vs. timestamps.

✅ 5) Final Preview
Show a preview of the parsed text with participant prefixes:

makefile
Copy
Edit
Alex: Hey, are you okay?  
Jamie: Yeah, I’m just tired.  
Let users edit names or fix text manually if needed.

✅ 6) “Analyze” button
Send the final labeled chat to the AI endpoint for insight analysis.

⚡ Key Phrases for Developers
Here’s a concise version you can copy/paste or send to your dev team:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
1. Allow multi-image uploads with reordering (thumbnails).
2. Add UI toggle: "My messages are on the left/right."
3. Capture participant names in input fields.
4. Use OCR (Tesseract.js or Google Vision) to extract text from each screenshot.
5. Parse text lines into individual messages based on bubble/spacing patterns.
6. Prefix each message with the appropriate participant name based on chosen side.
7. Show parsed chat preview to user for confirmation.
8. On submit, send structured chat text to AI for red flag & tone analysis.
💡 Pro Tip:
If your AI can also parse layout of screenshots, consider automating detection of sides using basic image processing (OpenCV.js or similar). But for most apps, a simple toggle for left/right + user names will cover 90% of scenarios and keep it user-friendly.
